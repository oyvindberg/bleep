# But my build does much more!

Yes, your build does other things.

It generates code, it distributes artifacts, it builds websites. Probably a lot more

But none of this has to be in the build itself!

### Introducing `scripts`

To take care of all these other tasks, Bleep introduces `scripts`.
Defined in your build file as the `scripts` in a `package.json`,
this mechanism allows you to run any class with a `main` method.
```yaml
projects:
  myscripts:
    dependencies:
      - build.bleep::bleep-plugin-mdoc:${BLEEP_VERSION}
    scala:
      version: 3.2.0
scripts:
  generate-docs: myscripts/bleep.scripts.GenDocumentation
```
   
### Running a script
You can run the script like this, it can be tab-completed to save some keystrokes
```sh
$ bleep generate-docs
```


### Complete freedom:

It might already be clear to you, but anyway:

- you can start this program from bleep (`bleep generate-docs`), from your IDE, from anywhere
- you can debug it like a normal program
- you have all the structured info from the build, without having to express code in your build
- you can include any dependencies you want, from any scala version. No class loader issues.
- you can even write your scripts for any platform
- Most interesting sbt plugins can be ported to Bleep quite easily! Bleep comes with some plugins already ported.

### An example script

This script uses `mdoc` and `docusaurus` plugins. Look how it composes the plugins, and how it parses command line arguments to determine which method (which used to be sbt task) to call.
Also note that it refers to `scriptsProject`, compiles it, gives it to `mdoc` in order for it to compile snippets with classpath for that project.

import GenNativeImage from '!!raw-loader!@site/../scripts/src/scala/bleep/scripts/GenDocumentation.scala';
import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock';

<CodeBlock language="scala" >{GenNativeImage}</CodeBlock>

#### Composing plugins
You can pass an instance of a plugin to another plugin. It's super clear and just normal code. This is what it looks like at use-site

```scala
val dynVer = new DynVerPlugin(baseDirectory = started.buildPaths.buildDir.toFile, dynverSonatypeSnapshots = true)
val pgp = new PgpPlugin(
  logger = started.logger,
  maybeCredentials = None,
  interactionService = InteractionService.DoesNotMaskYourPasswordExclamationOneOne
)
val sonatype = new Sonatype(
  logger = started.logger,
  sonatypeBundleDirectory = started.buildPaths.dotBleepDir / "sonatype-bundle",
  sonatypeProfileName = "build.bleep",
  bundleName = "bleep",
  version = dynVer.version,
  sonatypeCredentialHost = Sonatype.sonatype01
)
val ciRelease = new CiReleasePlugin(started.logger, sonatype, dynVer, pgp)

ciRelease.ciRelease(...)
```
