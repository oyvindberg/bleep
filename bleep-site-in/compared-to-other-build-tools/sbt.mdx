# Comparison with sbt

Sbt is in many respects an awesome tool, it really is. But it is the wrong tool.

## It is complex

The case against sbt has been made before, most eloquently by Li Haoyi in the [So, what's wrong with SBT?](https://www.lihaoyi.com/post/SowhatswrongwithSBT.html) blog post.

## It is slow

Even worse, it is also slow.
- Starting a JVM is slow.
- Starting a Scala compiler is slow
- Compiling the build is slow
- Evaluating the build is slow
- Resolving dependencies is slow
- Every plugin introduces more slowness, multiplied by number of projects

## It cannot manage its own build files

The build file is arbitrarily complicated scala code.
The most common build changes like dependency updates, project renames, combining projects are manual operations.
