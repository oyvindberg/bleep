## Comparison with scala-cli

Scala-cli is written with the same tech stack as Bleep. It is simple, it is fast, and it is awesome.

But it's a single-project build tool, so the scope is completely different.
The expected way of using scala-cli is that it's brilliant as long as your project is very small, and then you're expected to migrate to a proper build tool.
Bleep is meant to scale to as many projects as you want.
