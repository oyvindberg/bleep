# Bleep build model

To end up with the current Bleep file format, you start with a Bloop file.
This is a very verbose format with everything already resolved.
Bleep adopts the model, but makes it easier to work with.

## Bloop format

import BloopFile from '!!raw-loader!@site/static/scripts-bloopfile.notjson';

### YAML

Use YAML, because it's easier to write and more compact.

### More projects

One project is way too little:
```yaml
projects:
  a: {}
  b:
    dependsOn: a
```

### Relative paths

A build file must be independent of a given machine.

All paths in bloop files are resolved absolute paths, so instead Bleep uses relative paths exclusively:

```yaml
projects:
  a:
    # specifies project folder. it's relative to build root, and defaults to ./${PROJECT_NAME}
    folder: ./project-a
```

#### Replacements

You'll hate this section.

### Specify dependencies by maven coordinates

Bleep uses coursier extensively, also to resolve imports. See [dependencies](../usage/dependencies) for more details
```yaml
projects:
  myapp:
    dependencies: com.lihaoyi::fansi:0.3.1
```

### Deduplicate

Bloop files list all transitive dependencies. Bleep can of course reconstruct these lists.
Projects inherit dependencies from the projects they depend on.

### Normalize

`bleep.yaml` is very normalized:

- `null` / empty values are dropped
- short syntax is used for lists of one
- everything is sorted alphabetically
- everything is deduplicated, including for instance declaring a dependency you had already inherited

### Templates

So all the changes listed above would leave us with a somewhat manageable build, maybe some ten-ish lines per project.
To further reduce this, we use "templates" (for a lack of a better name).

```yaml
projects:
  a:
    extends: template-common
  b:
    dependsOn: a
    extends: template-common

templates:
  template-common:
    scala:
      version: 3.2.0
```

This is actually modelled on best-practice usage of sbt
```scala
lazy val a =
  project
    .configure(templateCommon)

lazy val b =
  project
    .configure(templateCommon)
    .dependsOn(a)

lazy val templateCommon: Project => Project =
  _.settings(
    scalaVersion := "3.2.0"
)
```

## Example `bleep.yaml`

import RunNativeYaml from '!!raw-loader!@site/static/demos/run-native.yaml';

<CodeBlock language="yaml" >{RunNativeYaml}</CodeBlock>
