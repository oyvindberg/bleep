# Porting sbt plugins!

There are many sbt plugins which are super useful, and we certainly don't want to lose them when using Bleep.

The solution is to port them:
- sbt plugins are `class`es
- sbt settings are `lazy val`s
- sbt tasks are `def`s
- input parameters are input parameters.

Have a look in the [liberated](https://github.com/oyvindberg/bleep/tree/master/liberated) folder in the github repo to see what it looks like, compared to sbt it is incredibly much easier to follow.

## Example ported plugin: DynVerPlugin

Look at how easy it is to follow!

import DynVerPlugin from '!!raw-loader!@site/..//liberated/sbt-dynver/sbtdynver/src/main/scala/sbtdynver/DynVerPlugin.scala';

<CodeBlock language="scala">
{DynVerPlugin}
</CodeBlock>

## Limitations

### Scopes
Bleep do not have scopes, instead for instance the test scope is represented as normal projects.
If you're porting an sbt plugin which makes heavy use of scopes, some more refactoring may be needed.

### Global namespace
Some sbt plugins mutate the global state, and this is how values are passed between plugins and sbt.
In Bleep these values must be passed as parameters

### Probably more
...

## Distribution

After porting, these plugins can be (cross-) published to maven central just like any other library.
