# Dependencies

Dependencies in Bleep are specified *almost* like in sbt, mill and so on

## Java dependency

Java dependencies separate coordinate parts by colon (like sbt's `%`)

```yaml
- org.scalameta:svm-subs:101.0.0
```

## Scala dependency

Scala dependencies use two colons after organization (similar to sbt's `%%`)
```yaml
- com.monovore::decline:2.3.1
```

## Scala.js / Scala Native dependency

Surprise! These also use two colons, not three like in sbt.
```yaml
    - com.lihaoyi::pprint:0.8.0
```

### But that's not like sbt does it!?
Bleep flips the default, the easiest syntax should be used for the most common thing.

If you want to add such a Scala JVM dependency to a JS/Native project, you can use the long form and a boolean flag

```yaml
- forceJvm: true
  module: com.softwaremill.sttp.client3::httpclient-backend-fs2:3.3.18
```

## Long form
As seen above, if you manually change this short form

```yaml
- org.scala-sbt::librarymanagement-core:1.7.1
```

to this long form:

```yaml
- module: org.scala-sbt::librarymanagement-core:1.7.1
```

you can now tweak the dependency further.
```yaml
 - exclusions:
     org.scala-sbt: util-logging_2.13
   for3Use213: true
   module: org.scala-sbt::librarymanagement-core:1.7.1
```

You'll also get IDE support for navigating this:

## Dependency upon sbt plugins
This lets you build sbt plugins with bleep (note that publishing is not implemented yet)
```yaml
    dependencies:
    - isSbtPlugin: true
      module: ch.epfl.scala:sbt-scalajs-bundler:0.20.0
    - configuration: provided
      module: org.scala-sbt:sbt:1.5.5
```

## Updating dependencies
bleep can update it's own dependencies using cli commands. 
```shell
bleep build update-deps
```
will update all the dependencies of a build. It is also possible to specify a single dependency or dependencies of a single organization to upgrade using the command
```shell
bleep build update-dep com.example::foo
# Alternatively for all dependencies of the organization
bleep build update-dep com.example
```
The update commands support two flags:
  - --prerelease which updates to the latest prerelease version if possible
  - --steward which makes the update command update to the version according to the same strategy that Scala Steward uses. Detailed description of the strategy can be found [here](https://github.com/scala-steward-org/scala-steward/blob/main/docs/faq.md#how-does-scala-steward-decide-what-version-it-is-updating-to).

## Limitations

Note that Bleep has shed support for the most intricate ivyisms. What is left makes the structure much more cacheable, and should be enough for 99% of projects.
