# Selecting projects

Your build may have many projects, so there is some built-in convenience to select groups of projects.

Whenever you give project names to a bleep command, for instance to `bleep compile/test/publish-local`, you can provide `crossId`s instead. This will select a group of cross projects with that `crossId`.
If you have worked with a cross-built project you will have seen names like `myproject@jvm213` - the `crossId` is the part after `@`.

Note that any transitive dependencies will also be selected.

These groups are discoverable because they also appear in [tab-completions](../tab-completions).

## Understand which projects are chosen
You can pass the group names to `bleep projects` to see which projects are implied by a group
```sh
$ bleep projects jvm213
ðŸ“— Launching Bleep version 0.0.1-M18 as requested in /Users/oyvind/bleep/bleep.yaml [t => 11 ms]
ðŸ“— bootstrapped in 5 ms [t => 18 ms]
ðŸ“— bleep-cli [t => 20 ms]
ðŸ“— bleep-cli-test [t => 20 ms]
ðŸ“— bleep-core@jvm213 [t => 20 ms]
ðŸ“— bleep-model@jvm213 [t => 20 ms]
ðŸ“— bleep-tasks-mdoc@jvm213 [t => 20 ms]
ðŸ“— bleep-tasks-publishing@jvm213 [t => 20 ms]
ðŸ“— bleep-tasks@jvm213 [t => 20 ms]
ðŸ“— bleep-test-harness@jvm213 [t => 20 ms]
ðŸ“— scripts [t => 20 ms]
ðŸ“— scripts-init [t => 20 ms]
```

## Selecting projects via subfolders
If you have grouped your projects in subfolders, you can use the subfolders to select projects
```sh
$ pwd
$HOME/pr/tapir
$ bleep projects|wc -l
     522
$ cd integrations/
$ bleep projects|wc -l
      87
$ bleep projects-test|wc -l
      44
```
This means that running `bleep compile` in `integrations` will compile the projects contained within

## Intersection of subfolders and names

These two approaches compose so you can use both at the same time:
```sh
$ cd integrations/
$ bleep projects jvm213|wc -l
      19

```
## Setting up build in IDE

You can also use (combinations of) project names and group names when setting up which projects
will be made available in your IDE!

Note: subfolder selection does not work when setting up projects in IDE
