# More stable builds

In order to work towards stable builds, Bleep manages some software which is often just picked up from the environment,
will typically be different between computers.

## Bleep manages itself

Bleep functions as a launcher for itself.
You specify the version you want in `bleep.yaml`, and it'll automatically download and run the specified version

```yaml
$version: 0.0.1-M18
```

Note that this can be overridden by supplying `--dev` to Bleep, in that case it will run the binary you have.

## Bleep manages JVMs

You can (optionally) specify a JVM to use for compiling and running your project.

```yaml
jvm:
  name: graalvm-java17:22.2.0
```

If you don't, Bleep will fallback to what is discovered through `JAVA_HOME`. Bleep will issue a warning when the JVM is managed externally.
To disable this warning you can use the managed value for the name key.

```yaml
jvm:
  name: managed
```

This is useful for projects that use other ways of managing the build environment.

## Bleep manages Node

For Scala.js projects, you can also specify the version of node you want to use. It'll also be automatically downloaded and used
```yaml
  my-js-project:
    platform:
      jsNodeVersion: 18.4.0
```

## Bleep does not (yet) manage LLVM (for Scala Native)

It is an open question whether it's feasible to supply a given version of LLVM.
